 * Enter any sequence of chords recognized by
   [pychord](https://github.com/yuma-m/pychord) separated by spaces
   and/or newlines. (Reference these [chord
   qualities](https://github.com/yuma-m/pychord/blob/main/pychord/constants/qualities.py).)
 * Each chord may be prefixed by a length. If omitted, a default
   length of 4 beats will be used.
 * Chords may be modified with [a slash
   chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_chord) (eg. `C/E` or
   `C/G`) or inverted (eg. `C/1`, `C/2`, `C/3` etc. for 1st, 2nd, and
   3rd order inversions of `C`).
 * As you type any chord, or as you move the text input cursor over an
   existing chord, the component keys of that chord are shown on the
   piano keyboard. Hold down `\` key (backslash) to play the
   highlighted chord audio. Hold `shift` + `\` to play the chord
   arpeggiated.
 * Use the `Tab` key to cycle through each of the chords. Use
     `shift` + `Tab` to cycle in the opposite direction.
 * Click the `Download MIDI` button to generate the MIDI file
   containing your entire chord progression.
