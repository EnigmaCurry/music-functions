Copyright Luke M Craig.

I have not found a license for the original work, but I have asked for
one: https://github.com/lukemcraig/NegativeHarmonizer/issues/7
However, in over two years I have not seen a response, so I am copying
this code here in good faith that the intention of publishing this
code to github was done for the purpose of sharing it freely. Many
thanks Luke!
